# Workspace ONE for Android Integration Guide Code
Android applications can be integrated with the VMware Workspace ONEÂ® platform,
by using its mobile software development kit. The Workspace ONE Integration
Guide for Android is a set of documents that contain instructions for
integration. This repository holds the code that is included in the guide
documents.

The code is organised as a project that can be built, for example with an
integrated development environment (IDE) such as Android Studio.

# How to use the repository code
The code in this repository can be used in the following ways.

-   Read the code snippets here, see the [snippets](Documentation/snippets.md)
    file.
-   Load the project into an IDE, see the [build](Documentation/build.md) file.

At this time, the integration guide documents themselves aren't in this
repository but that might change in future.
